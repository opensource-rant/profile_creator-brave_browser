# BraveBrowser Profile Creator

This project aims to automate profile management for the Brave Browser.

It uses `terraform` to generate `JSON` which conforms to the schema expected by
the BraveBrowser app.

#### Example usage

```
terraform plan -var profiles=["work, "study"]
```

#### TODO

A lot of testing...
